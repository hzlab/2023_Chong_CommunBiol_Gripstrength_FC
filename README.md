## Background

Converging evidence suggests that handgrip strength is linked to cognitive functioning in older adults, and this may be subserved by shared changes in brain function and structure in ageing. However, the interplay among handgrip strength, brain functional connectivity, and cognitive function remains poorly elucidated. Hence, our study sought to examine these relationships in a cohort of 148 community-dwelling older adults. Specifically, we examined brain network segregation, a summary measure of functional brain organization that is sensitive to ageing and cognitive decline, and its associations with handgrip strength and cognitive function. We showed that higher handgrip strength was related to better processing speed, attention performance, and global cognition in older adults. Individuals with higher handgrip strength also had higher brain functional segregation of the salience/ventral attention network, driven particularly by higher salience/ventral attention intra-network functional connectivity of the right anterior insula to the left posterior insula/frontal operculum and right midcingulate/medial parietal cortex. Importantly, these handgrip strength-related inter-individual differences in salience/ventral attention network functional connectivity were linked to cognitive function, as revealed by functional decoding and brain-cognition association analyses. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of the salience/ventral attention network in handgrip strength and cognition, and suggest that inter-individual differences in salience/ventral attention network segregation and intra-network functional connectivity could underpin the relationship between handgrip strength and cognition in older adults.
